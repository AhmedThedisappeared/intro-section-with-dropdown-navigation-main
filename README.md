## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, I need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this intro section with dropdown navigation and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I use A lot of tools  to help me complete the challenge. And I practice, A lot of thing.

My users are able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
